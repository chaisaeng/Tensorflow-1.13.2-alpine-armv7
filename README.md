Tensor Flow 1.13.2 Built for Alpine Linux running on Raspberry Pi
This is Tensorflow 1.13.2 built for alpine linux 3.11 runnning in a docker with python 3.7.
I have a homeassistant docker container running in a raspberry pi 3B it running fine with various iot devices.
After that I found out tensor flow was not pre installed on the docker image and there is none found elsewhere, 
the only option to enable image processing in my home assistant is built the .whl file on my own. I create this repository so that anyone need it will save some trouble enable this integration in home assistant docker container.
